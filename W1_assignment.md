### useR! 2020: Reactor: reactive notebooks for R (H. Susmann), lightening

In this video Herb Susmann is presenting his work named as "Reactor" that is explained as a new package that creates a new method for using R in a different user experience. He states his new form shows resemblance with previous examples such as Jupyter Notebook or Shiny or Observable. But it is falling apart from them by the reactiveness feature he reports. Briefly he defines reactor as a reactor notebook interface for R. In other words he describes "Reactor" as a notebook application that enables using R code but if you change any variable in a cell, that causes an automatic update of other cells referenced with the changed variable directly or indirectly. It looks like an excel sheet/cell update mechanism. However in a form of R notebook. It also gives an opportunity use R code with packages plots, HTML, LayTex and markdown all in one in a reactive interface. There is a short demo in the video. The link for the video is provided below.
